This is the first time I've done front-end web development to create something
that wasn't a throw-away project. There is definitely too much duplication, but
I will hopefully get rid of that once I feel a little more comfortable with using
inheritance in JS.

I was happy with how easy it was to create a Next.js app and how fast it is in
production.

## Development commands

* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run in development locally: `npm run dev`
* Build for production environment: `npm run build`

> Testing won't really *do* anything
