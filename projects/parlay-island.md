Fall of 2020, I took Computer Science 408 (Delivering Software) where I wrote 
an education review tool in the form of a Unity web game with a matching teacher
platform where teachers can easily change the questions their students are
quizzed on and see how well students are answering certain questions.

## Serving as PM

I served as the Project Manager for the team, so I managed Scrum events for
our team including story grooming and retrospective. At the beginning of the
Fall, our team struggled with team communication and transparency. We each had
many blockers but several team members were not sharing what was blocking them.
Our team launched experiments to fix these issues including a rule that everyone
must list a blocker during standups. After this experiment (which we turned
into a team policy), our team's communication drastically improved. More often,
our team discovered that we were dealing with similar issues or issues that
other people in the team had already dealt with, so our team's increased
transparency improved our ability to clear blockers.
